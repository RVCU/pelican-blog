A pedestrian crossing at Pimisi LRT station (like the ones that cross Somerset near Percy) is needed. People are constantly trying to cross across 4 lanes of traffic and someone is going to get hit one day. Asking people to walk down and through the terminal to cross sides is, I think, the wrong call. We already have enough infrastructure that caters to cars and drivers and we need to start planning for pedestrians, cyclists and transit users first.
