Just got a Roku TV but dissapointed to see that most of the Canadian News broadcasters like CBC don't have an app for Roku. They have ios apps but they don't allow you to cast to the Roku TV either. I'd really like to find a way to watch those livestreams easily. Building a custom Roku app to gather these livestreams seems like it wouldn't be too hard. 

_Wants_
    * app should display a list of livestreams that are monitored by the app
    * livestreams might not be at dependable links so may have to do a scan (probably on user input so don't get flagged as a bot)
    * user clicks an active stream and the app grabs that stream and plays it

Was able to grab the stream (on CBC) by looking at the network console and grabbing the master link when the livestream starts so hopefully this is possible.
