A pedestrian crossing at Pimisi LRT station (like the ones that cross Somerset near Percy) is needed. People are constantly trying to cross across 4 lanes of traffic and someone is going to get hit one day. Asking people to walk down and through the terminal to cross sides is, I think, the wrong call. We already have enough infrastructure that caters to cars and drivers and we need to start planning for pedestrians, cyclists and transit users first.

*EDIT 2019-11-27* saw an older man trip on the median and fall into the road, really bad. Ran and helped him up while other people stopped traffic for him. Really need pedestrian protection there ASAP.
