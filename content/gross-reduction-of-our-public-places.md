I hate this kind of stuff, you see it in all the new stuff put up by the city. Purposefully uncomfortable so that people (specifically poor people) won't feel comfortable and don't hang around. Can't have people feeling too comfortable existing where rich people live??? 

If you can't tell that picture is supposed to be some kind of pseudo bench you can lean against instead of sit down.
